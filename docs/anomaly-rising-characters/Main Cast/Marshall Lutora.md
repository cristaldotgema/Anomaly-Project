### Summary

Marshall Lutora is a Wakanean anomalous human working in Judicia as an anomaly operative trainer.

### General Appearance

Marshall's brown hair rests in a loose, messy bun—sometimes sagging between shoulder blades, other occasions resting on the apex of the back of his head. The small sprigs of loose hair have a mild wave. His eyes are mixed shades of golden brown, and his skin is tan with obvious gradients from the sun when undressed. A maroon ring surrounds his pupil, and his iris turns maroon when he uses energy. Freckles dust Marshall's broad nose and full cheeks, some hiding among his scruffy, short beard. Marshall stands shorter than the average man by a few inches, and secretly wears height-boosting shoes. In terms of body proportion, Marshall is absolutely *stacked*, resembling chubby strong-men builds seen in weight lifters. Always lagging beyond in trends, Marshall—much to his own chagrin—wears outfits that are "soooo last year", which embarrasses him. 

### Likes/Hobbies/Talents

Marshall loves video games more than life itself, and would be a professional gamer full-time if he was any good at it. In addition, Marshall writes short prose and rap songs, none of which he is confident enough to display for others to observe. He also loves indie rock bands. In addition, Marshall is an avid cannabis enthusiast who once made the mistake of trying spice. Doesn't like to talk about it. Also kind of a film bro but embarrassed about it.

### Bio

Your babygirl boyfriend who kinda sucks.

What is greatly evident about Marshall from the moment you meet him is his eagerness to make nice and be friends, jolly and positive when introduced to new people.

Marshall constantly grasps for approval in manners both subtle and in-your-face. Pushing to be the best, to succeed beyond everyone's expectations, Marshall tries so hard and falls so short. Touch-starved, anxious, and unsure of himself, Marshall yearns for deep connections and has little idea how to form them, and any connections he makes, he unintentionally projects his own misconceptions and emotions onto. Marshall is uneasy around his idols and people he finds attractive, often stuttering amid conversations.

Marshall has little reservation about throwing himself into the front lines of danger, volunteering his own life before others. However, in the face of actual adversity, if Marshall feels outnumbered or inferior, he is the first to flee and cower behind someone stronger. In general, Marshall is somewhat pitiful in nature, but tries to disguise his oddities with an upbeat attitude. Despite this, Marshall is the first one to suggest violent or over-dramatic tactics at a board meeting, almost chomping at the bit to come off as bold and intelligent.

While feigning the part of a caring, big brother figure, Marshall is unable to comprehend the complexities of being a nurturer, and often fumbles in execution. He means well, but often falls short of how to properly cheer someone up. In spite of not being a perfect role model, Marshall protects of those he perceives as family, even if it's ill-advised or ignorant to do so. With an open mind and an understanding of marginalization, Marshall adapts well to social change, and always keeps in mind the updating languages and terms for his friends. 

Marshall fights for the best outcome to the point of naivety. Even when trapped in a situation gone awry, Marshall refuses to compromise until the last minute. This flies in the face of his cowardly nature, but Marshall denies defeat: even honorable ones. Marshall is not an optimist, but is prone to latching onto ideas and not letting go—in fact, Marshall, is a pessimist, expecting the worst, but gunning hard for the best.

Marshall thinks aloud, since he lacks a coherent inner voice, his own thoughts screaming at him 24/7. In a cloud of hyperactive noise, Marshall talks to himself when in private. When having thoughtful or serious discussions with friends, Marshall's dialogs will often manifest as a stream-of-consciousness, his gears grinding to a halt when he accidently says something he doesn't mean or fumbles his wording. Often, Marshall will rephrase himself over and over. Marshall cannot hold a coherent conversation without his hands pantomiming along.

Although Marshall is talkative, he is out of touch with his emotions, good or bad. When asked about the positives, he'll detail them, but act as if surprised that he has feelings at all. In Wakane, it's not socially acceptable to brag about good things in your life, nor to be emotionally vulnerable to those you don't connect with. Yet often, Marshall will expose his real thoughts and opinions, only to backpedal hard.

When forced to work with someone he despises, Marshall wears his annoyance on his sleeve, undisguised, and has a hard time controlling his temper. If forced, Marshall will work with an adversary, but with as much spite as he can muster, wrinkling his nose and flipping them off behind their back.

Far from the prestige of some of his fears, but not without accomplishments of his own, Marshall, experiences relentless imposter syndrome. Envious and harboring an inferiority complex, Marshall inadvertently holds his trainee back from her full potential.

Quick to isolate and self-neglect, Marshall drowns in his despair and guilty conscious, sequestering himself in his quarters and loathing everything he's become.

### Daily Life
Being a trainer with only one trainee, Marshall throws all his effort into training Mikko, despite his obvious inexperience.

Unable to prevent his fumbling and clumsy nature from showing, Marshall is victim to many a pratfall, notorious for snapping bones and dislocating limbs on a monthly basis. 

Despite dealing with aberrations and demonic entities on a daily basis, Marshall refuses to believe in ghosts, specifically. For reasons beyond understanding, Marshall has somehow dodged every single ghost in his vicinity, even when someone points out a ghost, as soon as Marshall spins around to look, the ghost vanishes, as if playing a trick.

Unable to properly infer his peers properly, Marshall is a poor judge of personality and character, and often describes people in falsehoods without realizing it. Marshall also quickly buys into group conspiracy.

Marshall wants to fit in more than anything, but has difficulty comprehending *how*. 
Running from his social fears and anxieties, Marshall gets high every day he's off, and buries himself in video games and rock music.

Marshall loathes work and sees it as an almost unbearable burden, but rarely complains in any meaningful way about it.

Is a lefty and thinks that's weird, so tries to be a righty. Fails.

### Fighting Technique

Unless there's a reason to run, Marshall approaches fights with no reservations, guns blazing—kind of a brawler type, but just as keen with slinging his ringblade at an enemy as he is using it as an oddly-shaped sword. His defense is lackluster.

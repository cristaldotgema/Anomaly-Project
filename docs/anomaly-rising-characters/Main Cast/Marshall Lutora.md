### Bio

A little devil bastard.

Consistently insincere in their words and affect, Aure is a theatrical villain archetype. To their group mates, Aure's superficial charm is a honeyed and false depiction of their true intentions. Even compliments and singing praise feel like backhanded insults. Rarely does Aure voice how they really feel, even then dousing their distaste in condescension. Aure lives and breathes drama and enjoys other's misery.

They reply to peers with a smug, cocksure attitude. With a trill and wicked flourish, Aure snickers in amusement at other's misfortune. Aure nicknames their group mates “darling” and “dearest” and “poor thing”, much to their chagrin.

Conversations with Aure are less of an exchange of ideas and more of a power play. Most find it exhausting or irritating, while some submit under the pressure. Seeking to dominate conversation, Aure ruthlessly pries at others' psyches. There are few boundaries Aure won't cross, being only the most morally reprehensible. Aure envisions themself a puppet master, tugging away at strings. Even when one is aware of Aure’s misdeeds, they fall prey to their whims They take every opportunity to prove they are, in fact, better than you. Aure is larger than life and difficult to ignore.

Aure is lascivious and hedonistic. They love to indulge in carnal pleasures, drinking and seducing others. They experience no guilt for indulging in their desires. Aure is a slave to their vanity and narcissism.

  <summary>Spoilers (Toggle)</summary>
  <div>
Aure is a rebel and a spy infiltrating the group. While poorly disguising this fact, most assume they’re only a theatrical edge lord operative.

Another one of Aure's many secrets is their demonhood. In their natural state, Aure has claws, fangs, black cat ears atop their head, a tail, and paw-like feet. In their first life, they were an AO slaughtered by a group captain for disobeying orders. Aure, fueled by revenge, rose back up as a demon, and joined the resistance efforts. While Aure is technically more morally sound than their peers in Group #113, they’re a rebel for one reason: vengeance. Aure disguises their anger, but is the angriest in the main cast. Their efforts to annoy, alienate, and deprecate their group peers is petty vindication. In all reality, Aure is a trauma-laden and shy person, emotionally stunted by anguish. Aure would not treat their friends the way they treat an operative. Aure doesn’t care about insults or people treating them poor. They do, however, care about others who want to unmask their true intentions—i.e., their isolation due to anger and a fear of intimacy with others. Aure is read for filth a small handful of times in canon, leaving them stunned and speechless.

### Daily Life

Aure doesn't showcase the details of their personal life, shadowing their location on their days off of work. Though the group can't stand them, Aure frequently wakes up in the other group mates' beds.

### Fighting Technique

Aure disorients their opponents by circling them throughout the battle. As the fastest AO in their group, Aure bounds from left to right, refusing their enemy the opening to retaliate. What Aure lacks in offense, they make up for in stamina and speed. They enjoy teasing their enemies, but they favor ambush attacks more. Despite Aure’s endless bravado, their kills are (relatively) clean. Aure only uses their sickles in battle—never do they use a pistol, unlike their peers. They function surprisingly well in groups—though not without irritating their peers. Aure is virtually impossible to catch, congealing to wisps of smoke out of enemy grasp.

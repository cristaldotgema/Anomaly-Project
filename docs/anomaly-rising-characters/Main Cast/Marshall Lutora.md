### Summary

Marshall Lutora is a Wakanean anomalous human working in Judicia as an anomaly operative trainer.

### General Appearance

Marshall's brown hair rests in a loose, messy bun—sometimes sagging between shoulder blades, other occasions resting on the apex of the back of his head. The small sprigs of loose hair have a mild wave. His eyes are mixed shades of golden brown, and his skin is tan with obvious gradients from the sun when undressed. A maroon ring surrounds his pupil, and his iris turns maroon when he uses energy. Freckles dust Marshall's broad nose and full cheeks, some hiding among his scruffy, short beard. Marshall stands shorter than the average man by a few inches, and secretly wears height-boosting shoes. In terms of body proportion, Marshall is absolutely *stacked*, resembling chubby strong-men builds seen in weight lifters. Always lagging beyond in trends, Marshall—much to his own chagrin—wears outfits that are "soooo last year", which embarrasses him. 

### Likes/Hobbies/Talents

Marshall loves video games more than life itself, and would be a professional gamer full-time if he was any good at it. In addition, Marshall writes short prose and rap songs, none of which he is confident enough to display for others to observe. He also loves indie rock bands. In addition, Marshall is an avid cannabis enthusiast who once made the mistake of trying spice. Doesn't like to talk about it. Also kind of a film bro but embarrassed about it.

### Summary

Aure Mercer is an anomalous human working in Judicia as an anomaly operative in the infantry rank. An uncontrollable tease and flirt, Aure is infamous for their insatiable need to grate their peers' nerves. All weaknesses displayed around Aure are exploited for their pleasure.

### General Appearance

Aure wears a maroon colored hair tied in a low ponytail, trailing to darkened red to the tips in a fluid gradient.  Their eyes are light brown. A gold ring surrounds their left pupil, and a red ring surrounds their right. Their iris turns gold and red when they use energy. Shiny, black nail polish dons Aure's fingers.  A single scar over the lips nicks Aure's smooth brown skin. Scratchy, darkened facial hair frame their jaw and upper lip. They are a mesomorph, with most muscle retained in their thighs. Aure's toothy smiles house sharpened canines.

### Likes/Hobbies/Talents

The hobbies and talents of Aure are a mystery.

Spoilers: <spoiler>They really love math.</spoiler>

### Bio

Your babygirl boyfriend who kinda sucks.

What is greatly evident about Marshall from the moment you meet him is his eagerness to make nice and be friends, jolly and positive when introduced to new people.

Marshall constantly grasps for approval in manners both subtle and in-your-face. Pushing to be the best, to succeed beyond everyone's expectations, Marshall tries so hard and falls so short. Touch-starved, anxious, and unsure of himself, Marshall yearns for deep connections and has little idea how to form them, and any connections he makes, he unintentionally projects his own misconceptions and emotions onto. Marshall is uneasy around his idols and people he finds attractive, often stuttering amid conversations.

Marshall has little reservation about throwing himself into the front lines of danger, volunteering his own life before others. However, in the face of actual adversity, if Marshall feels outnumbered or inferior, he is the first to flee and cower behind someone stronger. In general, Marshall is somewhat pitiful in nature, but tries to disguise his oddities with an upbeat attitude. Despite this, Marshall is the first one to suggest violent or over-dramatic tactics at a board meeting, almost chomping at the bit to come off as bold and intelligent.

While feigning the part of a caring, big brother figure, Marshall is unable to comprehend the complexities of being a nurturer, and often fumbles in execution. He means well, but often falls short of how to properly cheer someone up. In spite of not being a perfect role model, Marshall protects of those he perceives as family, even if it's ill-advised or ignorant to do so. With an open mind and an understanding of marginalization, Marshall adapts well to social change, and always keeps in mind the updating languages and terms for his friends. 

Marshall fights for the best outcome to the point of naivety. Even when trapped in a situation gone awry, Marshall refuses to compromise until the last minute. This flies in the face of his cowardly nature, but Marshall denies defeat: even honorable ones. Marshall is not an optimist, but is prone to latching onto ideas and not letting go—in fact, Marshall, is a pessimist, expecting the worst, but gunning hard for the best.

Marshall thinks aloud, since he lacks a coherent inner voice, his own thoughts screaming at him 24/7. In a cloud of hyperactive noise, Marshall talks to himself when in private. When having thoughtful or serious discussions with friends, Marshall's dialogs will often manifest as a stream-of-consciousness, his gears grinding to a halt when he accidently says something he doesn't mean or fumbles his wording. Often, Marshall will rephrase himself over and over. Marshall cannot hold a coherent conversation without his hands pantomiming along.

Although Marshall is talkative, he is out of touch with his emotions, good or bad. When asked about the positives, he'll detail them, but act as if surprised that he has feelings at all. In Wakane, it's not socially acceptable to brag about good things in your life, nor to be emotionally vulnerable to those you don't connect with. Yet often, Marshall will expose his real thoughts and opinions, only to backpedal hard.

When forced to work with someone he despises, Marshall wears his annoyance on his sleeve, undisguised, and has a hard time controlling his temper. If forced, Marshall will work with an adversary, but with as much spite as he can muster, wrinkling his nose and flipping them off behind their back.

Far from the prestige of some of his fears, but not without accomplishments of his own, Marshall, experiences relentless imposter syndrome. Envious and harboring an inferiority complex, Marshall inadvertently holds his trainee back from her full potential.

Quick to isolate and self-neglect, Marshall drowns in his despair and guilty conscious, sequestering himself in his quarters and loathing everything he's become.

### Daily Life
Being a trainer with only one trainee, Marshall throws all his effort into training Mikko, despite his obvious inexperience.

Unable to prevent his fumbling and clumsy nature from showing, Marshall is victim to many a pratfall, notorious for snapping bones and dislocating limbs on a monthly basis. 

Despite dealing with aberrations and demonic entities on a daily basis, Marshall refuses to believe in ghosts, specifically. For reasons beyond understanding, Marshall has somehow dodged every single ghost in his vicinity, even when someone points out a ghost, as soon as Marshall spins around to look, the ghost vanishes, as if playing a trick.

Unable to properly infer his peers properly, Marshall is a poor judge of personality and character, and often describes people in falsehoods without realizing it. Marshall also quickly buys into group conspiracy.

Marshall wants to fit in more than anything, but has difficulty comprehending *how*. 
Running from his social fears and anxieties, Marshall gets high every day he's off, and buries himself in video games and rock music.

Marshall loathes work and sees it as an almost unbearable burden, but rarely complains in any meaningful way about it.

Is a lefty and thinks that's weird, so tries to be a righty. Fails.

### Fighting Technique

Unless there's a reason to run, Marshall approaches fights with no reservations, guns blazing—kind of a brawler type, but just as keen with slinging his ringblade at an enemy as he is using it as an oddly-shaped sword. His defense is lackluster.

### Bio

A little devil bastard.

Consistently insincere in their words and affect, Aure is a theatrical villain archetype. To their group mates, Aure's superficial charm is a honeyed and false depiction of their true intentions. Even compliments and singing praise feel like backhanded insults. Rarely does Aure voice how they really feel, even then dousing their distaste in condescension. Aure lives and breathes drama and enjoys other's misery.

They reply to peers with a smug, cocksure attitude. With a trill and wicked flourish, Aure snickers in amusement at other's misfortune. Aure nicknames their group mates “darling” and “dearest” and “poor thing”, much to their chagrin.

Conversations with Aure are less of an exchange of ideas and more of a power play. Most find it exhausting or irritating, while some submit under the pressure. Seeking to dominate conversation, Aure ruthlessly pries at others' psyches. There are few boundaries Aure won't cross, being only the most morally reprehensible. Aure envisions themself a puppet master, tugging away at strings. Even when one is aware of Aure’s misdeeds, they fall prey to their whims They take every opportunity to prove they are, in fact, better than you. Aure is larger than life and difficult to ignore.

Aure is lascivious and hedonistic. They love to indulge in carnal pleasures, drinking and seducing others. They experience no guilt for indulging in their desires. Aure is a slave to their vanity and narcissism.

  <summary>Spoilers (Toggle)</summary>
  <div>
Aure is a rebel and a spy infiltrating the group. While poorly disguising this fact, most assume they’re only a theatrical edge lord operative.

Another one of Aure's many secrets is their demonhood. In their natural state, Aure has claws, fangs, black cat ears atop their head, a tail, and paw-like feet. In their first life, they were an AO slaughtered by a group captain for disobeying orders. Aure, fueled by revenge, rose back up as a demon, and joined the resistance efforts. While Aure is technically more morally sound than their peers in Group #113, they’re a rebel for one reason: vengeance. Aure disguises their anger, but is the angriest in the main cast. Their efforts to annoy, alienate, and deprecate their group peers is petty vindication. In all reality, Aure is a trauma-laden and shy person, emotionally stunted by anguish. Aure would not treat their friends the way they treat an operative. Aure doesn’t care about insults or people treating them poor. They do, however, care about others who want to unmask their true intentions—i.e., their isolation due to anger and a fear of intimacy with others. Aure is read for filth a small handful of times in canon, leaving them stunned and speechless.

### Daily Life

Aure doesn't showcase the details of their personal life, shadowing their location on their days off of work. Though the group can't stand them, Aure frequently wakes up in the other group mates' beds.

### Fighting Technique

Aure disorients their opponents by circling them throughout the battle. As the fastest AO in their group, Aure bounds from left to right, refusing their enemy the opening to retaliate. What Aure lacks in offense, they make up for in stamina and speed. They enjoy teasing their enemies, but they favor ambush attacks more. Despite Aure’s endless bravado, their kills are (relatively) clean. Aure only uses their sickles in battle—never do they use a pistol, unlike their peers. They function surprisingly well in groups—though not without irritating their peers. Aure is virtually impossible to catch, congealing to wisps of smoke out of enemy grasp.

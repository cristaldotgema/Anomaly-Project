Both a province representative and a group captain, Mikiya is beloved for his exemplary undertaking of leadership positions and extensive confirmed extermination count. Operatives idolize Mikiya as a role model and pseudo-celebrity. His endearing, thoughtful, and humorous charm seperate him from the cruel captains that infantry operatives expect.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="general-appearance">General Appearance<a class="hash-link" href="#general-appearance" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Mikiya&#x27;s dark brown hair sits above the nape of his neck, his tousled bangs rest just below his brow. His skin is light brown, and his eyes are dark brown. A green ring surrounds his pupil, and his iris turns green when he uses energy. His face is smooth, not a single scar or flaw to be seen. Structured for aerodynamic fights and speed, his lithe body cuts effortlessly through wind. Mikiya favors stylish, business-casual, and contemporary clothing—never too flashy nor too subdued. His glasses change to suit the colors of his outfits.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="likeshobbiestalents">Likes/Hobbies/Talents<a class="hash-link" href="#likeshobbiestalents" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Paradisian religious imagery—iconography of angel and church in particular—enthralls Mikiya. Gardens, forests, and plant life are Mikiya&#x27;s refuge from Paradiso&#x27;s urban sprawl. He decorates his room with flora of all kinds. Mikiya&#x27;s hobbies of composing, piano playing, and ballroom dancing are unsung and hidden cultivated talents.

Balancing his professional and casual persona with a witty and charismatic affect, Mikiya fosters a healthy work environment. Mikiya&#x27;s mastery of language and tone persuades others to heed his words with forethought. People flock to his magnetic confidence and his approachable, inviting demeanor. In contrast to the hotheaded captain stereotype, Mikiya openly compliments his fellow operatives and treats them as equals. He insists on rules that keep his group safe and sane, but relaxes rules that dictate self-expression. Trivial mischief slides on his watch, which boosts group morale. Mikiya is gracious with &#x27;please&#x27;s and &#x27;thank you&#x27;s and displays his gratitude in both his words and actions.</p><p>Saying others find Mikiya attractive is a grave understatement. Mikiya is beloved for his captivating looks as much as (if not more than) his personality. Handsome and alluring with a blemish-free face, Mikiya is a feast for the eyes. Mikiya is affectionate without restraint and plainly expresses his adoration for his peers. This extends to his romantic life—his open relationship with Hauna allows him companions that toe the line between friendship, love, and lust. His partners describe him as sensual and thoughtful.</p><p>Beyond the rare narrowed eyelids, Mikiya&#x27;s facial expressions show only joy and neutrality. Mikiya doesn&#x27;t display anger or sadness, and keeps his emotions reigned on a tight leash. Mikiya speaks in an even, calming voice, and never raises his voice. It will be a cold day in Hell before you catch Mikiya losing his temper. Even so much as a frown shall never grace his lips.
Mikiya is a compulsive over-worker, and requires observant friends to distract him from his responsibilities.</p><p>He is also vulnerable to possession and hypnosis.</p><div class="admonition admonition-info alert alert--info"><div class="admonition-heading"><h5><span class="admonition-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14" height="16" viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</h5></div><div class="admonition-content"><p>Mikya VS.<spoiler>Morgan</spoiler></p></div></div><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_BAp3" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Giant Spoilers (Toggle)</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div>Following the death of Mikiya&#x27;s ex, Mark, the “Mikiya” everyone knows consists of two entities. While both sides overlap and meld together, they are intrinsically fractured, differing in their core personality and motivations. Who holds primary control depends on the situation. All aspects of Mikiya explored in earlier sections is the façade both parties play. Their inner selves differ from what others perceive. They share most present memories.<p>This body holds the persons “Mikiya” and “Morgan”. When referring to the character “Morgan”, this is the demon that occupies the body along with the original person, “Mikiya”. Physical and emotional abuse formed Morgan, who now exists to protect Mikiya from harm. Morgan is also the legal name of the body, but in this profile (and usually in canon) “Morgan” refers to the demon.</p><p>Mikiya is unaware he shares a body with a demon. Morgan indirectly influences Mikiya, pulling the strings in the background. Mikiya assumes Morgan’s voice is his own subconscious, and their exchanged thoughts, Mikiya interprets as inner conflict.</p><p>Morgan differs from Mikiya in physical appearance inside their shared headspace. He has stark, prodigiously white skin, hair, and pupils. It’s as if he’s painted over and drained of color. Above his ears and behind his temples rest dark horns, curving back horizontally and curling upwards on the ends, resembling a headpiece of a crown. His sclera is abyssal black, along with his curling pointed tongue. Morgan’s soul color is a lighter shade of green than Mikiya’s. Though tame in appearance when compared to other demons, he transforms when starved or gravely threatened. His jaw tears open to reveal rows of razor-sharp teeth, the tips of his fingers hone to deadly talons. Morgan does not change the body’s physical appearance to match his own, presenting as Mikiya and disguising his true form.</p><p>Mikiya is traumatized and paranoid. He disguises his fears and worries, viewing them as personal weaknesses. Bearing  guilt for everything from abandoning Mikko to captain’s imposter syndrome, Mikiya holds himself accountable for all his misdeeds—perceived and real alike. He fears replacement, failure, authority, and his own (Morgan’s) violent streak. Repetition comforts Mikiya, repeating reassuring phrases in his mind to get him through stress, and stimming by drumming his fingers when no one is looking. Even with Hauna’s affection and the adoration of his group, Mikiya is starved of love. When stressed in solitude, Mikiya scratches at his neck until he bleeds. It is not intentional self-harm, but he never tries to break the habit. Despite his occupation and suicidal ideation, Mikiya loathes pain and cowers from killing himself.</p><p>Mikiya lives in the past. He misses his childhood, glossing over the pain, romanticizing what never was and can never be. He wants a redo in life; to be a kid once more, since his surroundings forced him to mature hastily. The past challenges Mikiya with rose-tinted nostalgia. Letting go of old relationships is impossible for Mikiya, whose prone to heartache. In the past and present, he tries to win the affections of people who mean him ill.</p><p>While Mikiya makes fruitless attempts to combat the racism he faces, Morgan drowns in internalized racism. He loathes that he was born Hoabi, and longs for the “prestige” of being a full-blooded Paradisian. Morgan is far easier to offend, especially if it challenges his status as a captain. Though he will not express this anger, Morgan forgives none for perceived slights. He loathes authority but is polite and respectful to those in power over him. Morgan is prone to bouts of mania due to his god complex, manifesting in intense battles or stand-offs with his group mates. He cares less about being morally “good” and much more about securing Mikiya&#x27;s future. Consequently, the only way to keep Mikiya and himself safe are to be on the top—in charge of everyone else. Outsiders are stepping stones on their path to power. He was born to protect Mikiya and will risk anything to carry out his goals.</p><p>Morgan is far more confident and self-assured than Mikiya on his own. He is well-spoken like Mikiya, but his honeyed words are deceptive. He manipulates and blackmails his peers to get what he desires. Morgan’s detachment from others allows his brutality. Morgan’s smugness and condescension outweighs Mikiya’s. Assuming the worst of everyone, he plans for friends to turn into foes, inevitably betraying Mikiya and himself. When angered, Morgan aims for any emotional weak spots in an individual, shamelessly stabbing at their insecurities until they submit. Like Mikiya, Hauna has Morgan spellbound. Despite his genuine devotion, Morgan is certain he will slay Hauna on his road to protecting Mikiya.</p><p>Morgan can justify anything if it means Mikiya thrives. In reality, Morgan is mercurial and reactive—though he views Mikiya as an emotionally immature child in dire need of his deliverance.</p><p>Mikiya speaks a dialect that integrates Wakanele and Communia. He only uses this dialect comfortably around his group—never around his bosses or unfamiliar colleagues in other groups (frequently adds -maru to the end of sentences to ask for approval, uses honorifics, sprinkles in well-known Wakanele idioms, etc.) Mikiya greatly favors Wakanele, his native language. If he can speak it without wrecking his reputation, he will. Morgan does not use this dialect and prefers to speak perfect Communia.</p><p>Though Mikiya and Morgan&#x27;s traits diverge, they share a common ethos. Both are instinctively protective and secretive. They  appear mysterious, but rarely comes off as untrustworthy. Both are obsessed with their polished persona. Mikiya and Morgan harbor deep resentment and rage, biting back harsh, cutting insults and rude opinions to save face. Reputation is everything to the pair, and anything against their reputation dwells in the abscesses of their minds. Repressing their quippy and irritable nature, Mikiya and Morgan carry on the illusion of the ideal human. Morgan threatens those who try to sully his reputation, while Mikiya is more likely to panic.</p><p>In no situation would either of them harm to a child. Early childhood trauma lends to their view of children as sacred and in need of protection. Both are openly aggressive to child abusers.</p><p>To Mikiya and Morgan, life is a performance, and there is no time to get off the stage. Only in short, fleeting moments are they seen breaking character in private; Morgan expressing rage, Mikiya expressing self-doubt and paranoia.</p><p>Because Mark’s abuse formed Morgan, Mikiya and Morgan suffer the same related triggers. If someone reaches for their forehead, temples, the side of the cranium, or eyes, both will react. Mikiya jumps backwards, eyes widened, while Morgan snatches the adversary&#x27;s wrist with a blank expression.</p><p>The reactions that appear on the surface depends on who is primarily in charge, but they both stick to the &quot;script” of the “perfect kindhearted captain” as best they can. They both use charm spells to perfect their physical appearance and boost their aura. With these spells not in use, the body’s flaws are on full display. The body carries scars and freckles scattered all over, and dark circles under and around the eyes. Both are obsessive with appearance.</p><p>Mikiya discovers Morgan’s existence later. Morgan cannot convince Mikiya to follow his advice or commands, and thus, fights Mikiya for control like tug-of-war. Only time will show who gains permanent control.</p><p>Morgan&#x27;s soul color is a lime green, and Mikiya&#x27;s color is forest green.</p></div></div></div></details><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="daily-life">Daily Life<a class="hash-link" href="#daily-life" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Mikiya relishes his group life, and functions at his best when he&#x27;s around people he enjoys—which thankfully is the situation at Group #113. Mikiya is usually found doing paperwork or cleaning, as he only allows himself to have free time if Hauna forces him to. Group functions and meals are the best time to interact with him in a friendly environment.</p><p>Mikiya frequently posts selfies, food pictures, and scenery to his sizable following on ChatMap.</p><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_BAp3" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Spoilers (Toggle)</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div>Mikiya enjoys pleasant escapism, like nature walks and piano playing. Morgan doesn&#x27;t have hobbies or ways to relax other than to spend time with Hauna. Mikiya and Morgan hyperfocus on work so hard that it sometimes conjures a spell.</div></div></div></details><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="fighting-technique">Fighting Technique<a class="hash-link" href="#fighting-technique" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Mikiya maintains composure well in battle. He is light on his feet, agile, and hits hard. Mikiya is a skilled and formidable opponent, as well as a clear communicator and shot caller. Though less violent than the worst of his group, Mikiya shows callous and brutal disregard for life in a handful of situations. That&#x27;s not a cause for concern for others, as it&#x27;s expected of a captain.</p><details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_BAp3" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Spoilers (Toggle)</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><div>Pretty obvious which one the brutality comes from. Mikiya uses his sword as one mass, spinning the middle handle and fanning the twin blades. Morgan prefers to separate the swords, use knives, and raw energy. Mikiya might hesitate in a gorey battle, whilst Morgan thrives in violent surroundings.<p>Mikiya’s kills are clinical and quick, while Morgan’s are slower, more personal, and meant to show off.</p></div></div></div></details></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/anomaly-rising-characters/main-cast/marshall-lutora"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Marshall Lutora</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/anomaly-rising-characters/main-cast/mikko-sateio"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Mikko Sateio</div></a></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_cNA8 thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#summary" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Summary</a></li><li><a href="#general-appearance" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">General Appearance</a></li><li><a href="#likeshobbiestalents" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Likes/Hobbies/Talents</a></li><li><a href="#bio" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Bio</a></li><li><a href="#daily-life" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Daily Life</a></li><li><a href="#fighting-technique" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Fighting Technique</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyleft © 2022 The Anomaly Project, Inc. by <a href="https://aremo-te.art">Aremo</a>, and advised by <a href="https://junjie.carrd.co/">Jun</a>.<br> Website built with Docusaurus, created and managed by <a href="https://cristaldotgema.com">Magz</a>.</div></div></div></footer></div>
